description: Present visual design options via design deck
---
Load the `design-deck` skill for the full format reference. If presenting UI component options (tabs, trees, buttons, accordions, etc.), also read the relevant file from the skill's `references/component-gallery/` directory — it has visual vocabulary across design systems plus guidance on when to use distinct systems vs variations of the same approach.

Analyze the current codebase and context, and present concrete visual options using `design_deck`.

Read relevant files aggressively first so you understand the real constraints before generating options. If there's a plan or PRD, read it in full along with every codebase file it references — understand the actual state of the code, not just what the document assumes. Then identify the key design and architecture decisions and present options for each.

Build 1 slide per decision with 2-4 genuinely distinct options — not tiny variants. Order slides foundational to aesthetic. Use the right preview format for the content: `previewBlocks` with code/mermaid/image blocks for technical comparisons, `previewHtml` with hand-rolled inline styles for UI mockups. Each UI option should look like a different designer made it — vary structure, typography, and spacing philosophy, not just colors.

Include concise `aside` text for trade-off summaries. Mark a recommendation when you have a clear opinion.

If the request is genuinely ambiguous or underspecified and no plan or PRD exists, interview me in depth first — but don't force discovery when you already have what you need.

The selections become the implementation contract. Ultrathink.
